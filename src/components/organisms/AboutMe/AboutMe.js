            Hello! As You probably know, my name is Michał. I'm from Poland and actually living in Rumia, near Tricity.
            I hope, that now i'm a nice pretender to become junior front-end developer and You're reading this means,
            that my dream can come true. I started learning web development in september 2021 and came a long way to
            learn what I know now, but i also know that my knowlege is like a raindrop in the sea. Fortunatelly I also
            learn a lot about myself and can guarantee, that I'll keep learning to become better and better. So, that's
            about my learning history, time for more personall stuff &#59;&#41; I completed economy studies at Gdańsk
            University, found beautiful and smart wive and after a few years as fire protection technician decided, that
            I want more opportunities to learn new thing and started learning programming. Also I have to admit, that
            I'm a big fan of boardgames and maybe a little fan of dad jokes :D
